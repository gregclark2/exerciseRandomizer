1. could add a range for each exercise and random roll reps/duration for fun

2. ask did you do it? before it shuts down...keep log...enable various kind of reports on
    excerises and total done that day - need to i/o to file to save

    - delimit with ','... String[] line = String.split(inputLine, ",").trim();
                        String name, repsdur;
                        int indexNum;
                    for(int i = 0, i < line.length; i++){
                        if i == 1{
                        indexNum = String.valueOf(line[i]);
                        }
                        ...use a switch case here?

                        no no while hasNextLine....Exercise entry = new Exercise(line[0], Integer.valueOf(line[1], line[2])

                    }

                    each completed exercise object check if today's date is the same as the last
                    entry in the 'calendar' or 'log' hashmap and if it's new sets new logging key to
                    new date - ACTUALLY this isn't necessary...

3. add in program enter delete and edit entry feature.
4. need menus to choose entry, edit, use/select, save.exit
